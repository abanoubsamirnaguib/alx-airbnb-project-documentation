# Airbnb Clone Backend - Data Flow Diagram

## Overview
This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone Backend System. The DFD illustrates how data moves through the system, showing the relationships between external entities, processes, and data stores.

## Files
- `airbnb-data-flow-diagram.drawio` - The Draw.io source file for the Data Flow Diagram
- `data-flow.png` - PNG export of the diagram (to be generated)

## Diagram Components

### External Entities
1. **Guest** - End users who search for and book properties
2. **Host** - Property owners who list and manage their properties
3. **Admin** - System administrators who manage the platform
4. **Payment Gateway** - External payment processing services (Stripe, PayPal)
5. **Notification Service** - External email/SMS services

### Core Processes
1. **1.0 User Authentication & Registration** - Handles user login, registration, and profile management
2. **2.0 Property Management** - Manages property listings, updates, and media
3. **3.0 Search & Filter Properties** - Processes search queries and filters results
4. **4.0 Booking Management** - Handles booking creation, updates, and cancellations
5. **5.0 Payment Processing** - Processes payments and handles refunds
6. **6.0 Reviews & Ratings** - Manages user reviews and rating systems
7. **7.0 Messaging & Communication** - Handles user-to-user messaging and notifications
8. **8.0 Admin Management** - Manages administrative functions and content moderation

### Data Stores
1. **D1 Users Database** - Stores user profiles, credentials, and preferences
2. **D2 Properties Database** - Stores property information, amenities, and media
3. **D3 Bookings Database** - Stores booking details and status information
4. **D4 Payments Database** - Stores transaction records and payment history
5. **D5 Reviews Database** - Stores user reviews and ratings
6. **D6 Messages Database** - Stores user communications and system notifications
7. **D7 Redis Cache** - Caches frequently accessed data for performance
8. **D8 Elasticsearch Index** - Provides fast search capabilities for properties

## Key Data Flows

### User Registration & Authentication
- Guests/Hosts provide registration data and login credentials
- System validates and stores user information
- Authentication tokens and session data are managed

### Property Search & Booking
- Guests search for properties using various criteria
- System queries property database and search index
- Search results are cached for performance
- Booking requests trigger availability validation and payment processing

### Payment Processing
- Booking confirmation triggers payment processing
- External payment gateways handle secure transactions
- Payment status updates are stored and communicated back to users

### Communication & Notifications
- System generates notifications for booking confirmations, payments, etc.
- Messages between hosts and guests are stored and delivered
- External notification services handle email/SMS delivery

### Reviews & Feedback
- Post-booking review collection from both guests and hosts
- Review data is processed and stored for future reference
- Reviews impact property ratings and search rankings

## Technology Stack Integration
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for transactional data
- **Redis** - Caching layer for improved performance
- **Elasticsearch** - Search and indexing engine
- **External APIs** - Payment gateways, notification services

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data flows are encrypted
- Payment processing follows PCI DSS compliance
- User authentication uses JWT tokens
- Input validation occurs at all process boundaries

## Performance Optimizations
- Caching of search results and frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for fast query responses
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- CDN integration for media delivery

This DFD represents the Level 0 (Context Diagram) view of the system, showing the major processes and data flows. Each process can be further decomposed into more detailed sub-processes in Level 1 and Level 2 diagrams if needed.
